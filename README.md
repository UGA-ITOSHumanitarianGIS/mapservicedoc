GISTMaps doc public repository

Global data for countries in CODs hosted for the humanitarian community as coordinated through [UN OCHA](https://www.unocha.org/) are documented in these pages.

Deployment status of map services (https://gistmaps.itos.uga.edu/arcgis/rest/services/COD_External) based on [UN OCHA processing protocols](https://data.humdata.org/organization/inform) are available in the [DOC folder](https://github.com/UGA-ITOSHumanitarianGIS/mapservicedoc/blob/master/Data/CODServiceDeploymentStatus.xlsx).

ITOS is planning an API for this tracking document. This way, organizations may include the status in their own spreadsheets or website documentation for these important source data automatically!
